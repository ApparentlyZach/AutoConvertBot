# AutoConvertBot
A discord bot which automatically parses comments for common SI and Metric units, converts them, and posts a handy little message.

The entire Bot is self contained, requiring only Python v3.6+ and the Discord.py library to be installed.

You are more than welcome to modify this code, to stream-line it, and/or to add it to your own project!

I do ask that you give credit it you do copy the code, or pieces of the code, verbatum.
